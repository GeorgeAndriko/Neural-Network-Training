# Neural-Network-Training
To implement a train feed forward neural network with a softmax layer.  Theneural  network  will  be  trained  and  tested  using  the  Fashion  MNIST  datasetthat provides 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples.  The neuralnetwork therefore is required to correctly classify each one of the 10,000 (28x28)greyscale test images into one the 10 fashion items.  The items of clothing areclassified using 0-9 integers and are listed as: 1.  T-shirt/top 
2.  Trouser 
3.  Pullover 
4.  Dress
5.  Coat
6.  Sandal 
7.  Shirt
8.  Sneaker
9.  Bag
10.  Ankle Boot 
The  training  network  will  be  coded  in  Python  and  will  make  use  of  theskeleton  code  provided.    In  order  to  fully  test  the  network,  the  remainingcode  will be  developed,  which  will include  a  back  propagation algorithm  anda mini-batch gradient descent.
The project was created for the needs of Neural Computation module-MSc Robotics.
It needs further optimization to produce better results.
